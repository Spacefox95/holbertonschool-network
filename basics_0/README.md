# Networking Basics #0

## Description

The "Networking Basics #0" project aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental networking concepts, focusing on the OSI model, different types of networks, and essential protocols. Understanding networking is crucial for anyone looking to work in IT, cybersecurity, or software development. This project cover the OSI model's layers and organization, as well as key networking concepts like Local Area Networks (LAN), Wide Area Networks (WAN), and the Internet. I also learned about IP addresses, the differences between TCP and UDP protocols, and essential networking tools. This foundational knowledge is essential for navigating the complexities of modern networked systems.

## Key Topics Covered

### OSI Model
- **What it is**: A conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers.
- **How many layers it has**: The OSI model consists of 7 layers.
- **How it is organized**: The layers are organized from the physical transmission of data to application-level interactions.

### Types of Networks
- **What is a LAN**:
  - **Typical usage**: Connects devices in a small geographical area, like a home, office, or school.
  - **Typical geographical size**: Typically limited to a single building or a group of nearby buildings.
  
- **What is a WAN**:
  - **Typical usage**: Connects multiple LANs over larger geographical areas, such as cities or countries.
  - **Typical geographical size**: Spans large distances, often across multiple regions or countries.
  
### The Internet
- **What is the Internet**: A global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols.
- **What is an IP address**: A unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, allowing it to communicate.
- **What are the 2 types of IP address**: 
  - IPv4: The original version of IP addresses, using a 32-bit format.
  - IPv6: A newer version designed to replace IPv4, using a 128-bit format.
- **What is localhost**: A hostname that refers to the current device, commonly used for testing and development.
- **What is a subnet**: A logical subdivision of an IP network, allowing for more efficient management and routing of IP addresses.
- **Why IPv6 was created**: To address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and to improve routing and network autoconfiguration.

### TCP/UDP
- **What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- **What is the main difference between TCP and UDP**: TCP is connection-oriented and ensures reliable transmission of data, while UDP is connectionless and allows for faster data transfer without guarantees.
- **What is a port**: A numerical identifier in networking that specifies a particular process or service on a device.
- **Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers**:
  - SSH: Port 22
  - HTTP: Port 80
  - HTTPS: Port 443
  
### Networking Tools
- **What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network**: Ping is commonly used to test the reachability of a host on a network.

This project serves as a foundational stepping stone for those interested in deepening their knowledge of networking principles and practices.
